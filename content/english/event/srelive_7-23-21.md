### About Event

There is a huge gap between classroom learning and the complexities of real-world environments, and during times of significant change this gap is formidable.
 
ModernApps Learning has its own vision, goals and infrastructure and we the community design, develop and deliver all aspects of the platform.  We are a project hosted by VMware and develop and manage production assets. We are much like many programs within large organizations, with one key difference - we are designed to be managed with and by our open community, facilitated by VMware.  
 
On the SRE Live! call we will be doing live planning, design, and implementation of all aspects of the ModernApps Learning Platform. We will be using agile planning and implement devops/gitops processes, CICD workflows, and strive step-by-step towards cloud native best practice implementations, together as a community.  
 
Hope to see you on the call!
